# What is this function
It's a function that checks if two words are anagrams.

# What does anagram mean
Anagrams are words that have the same exact characters even if in different arrangements.

# How to use?
- Clone the respository to your local machine
- Open a terminal and navigate to the folder on your machine
- Run `php index.php` to run the included checks.

## Examples:
- `acer` and `race` are anagrams because they consist of the exact same cahracters.
- `acer` and `care` are anagrams as well.
- `test` and `best` are NOT anagrams because there's a different character in each of them.

and so on..
